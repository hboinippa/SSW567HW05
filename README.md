The purpose of this homework is to apply the concepts from the lecture to static testing of your Triangles application. Specifically:

You will run a static code analyzer, such as Pylint, through your code to find any errors and fix them; You will extend your test cases to demonstrate code coverage of at least 80% and run a code coverage tool on your code, such as Coverage.py; For this assignment, you must download and set up the appropriate static code analysis and code coverage tools. You will then run those tools locally on your laptop to acquire the results.
